The project is evolving slowly, mostly because DevBuddy covers my current needs.

I would love to help people implement their languages/environments/tools/dev-flow.

## What is this?

**DevBuddy** is an open-source implementation of an amazing internal tool developed at
[Shopify](https://engineering.shopify.com) called "**Dev**".

The first goal of this tools is to automate the **setup** tasks required to work on a project.

With **DevBuddy**, pushing a change on a project you never touched look like this:

- `bud clone devbuddy/devbuddy`
- `bud up`
- `git commit`
- `bud test`
- `git push`

## Status and progress

**DevBuddy** is more useful for Python, Go and Node projects. More languages will be natively
supported. DevBuddy is still useful for languages without native support thanks to the **custom** task.

See the project config [documentation](docs/Config.md).

### Tasks:

Python:
- Python environment (pyenv + virtualenv)
- Pip (requirements file)
- Pipenv (support for [Pipfile](https://github.com/pypa/pipfile))

Go:
- Go environment (with GOPATH)
- Go modules
- Dep (support for [Go Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep))

Node:
- Node environment
- Dependencies with NPM
- Dependencies with Yarn **planned**

Ruby: **planned**

Rust: **planned**

Others:
- Homebrew
- Apt
- Custom (conditional shell command)
- Docker Compose (manage a docker-compose setup): **planned**

### Features:

- Notification when important files (eg: `requirements.txt`) are updated locally
  (eg: by `git pull`)
- A `help` command to guide a new developer based on `dev.yml`
- A `upgrade` command to auto-upgrade **DevBuddy**

### Code hosting platform:

- Github
- Gitlab
- Bitbucket (with Git)

### Shell integration

- Bash
- Zsh

## Install

### Homebrew

Install the Homebrew tap:
```bash
$ brew install devbuddy/devbuddy/devbuddy
```

Install the latest release:
```bash
$ brew install devbuddy
```

Install from the master branch:
```bash
$ brew install --HEAD devbuddy
```

### Go install

Note: use this if your your PATH includes the GOBIN path.

Latest release:
```bash
$ go install github.com/devbuddy/devbuddy/cmd/bud@latest
```

Specify a version, like `v0.11.1`:
```bash
$ go install github.com/devbuddy/devbuddy/cmd/bud@v0.11.1
```

### Manual

#### Select the version to download:

Latest:
```bash
$ VERSION=$(curl -Ls -o /dev/null -w %{url_effective} "https://github.com/devbuddy/devbuddy/releases/latest" | grep -oE "[^/]+$")
```

[Previous releases](https://github.com/devbuddy/devbuddy/releases):

```bash
$ VERSION="v0.12.0"
```

#### Download the binary

Linux Intel:
```bash
$ curl -L https://github.com/devbuddy/devbuddy/releases/download/${VERSION}/bud-linux-amd64 > /tmp/bud
```

Linux ARM:
```bash
$ curl -L https://github.com/devbuddy/devbuddy/releases/download/${VERSION}/bud-linux-arm64 > /tmp/bud
```

macOS Intel:
```bash
$ curl -L https://github.com/devbuddy/devbuddy/releases/download/${VERSION}/bud-darwin-amd64 > /tmp/bud
```

macOS Apple Silicon:
```bash
$ curl -L https://github.com/devbuddy/devbuddy/releases/download/${VERSION}/bud-darwin-arm64 > /tmp/bud
```

#### Install the binary

```bash
$ sudo install /tmp/bud /usr/local/bin/bud
```

## Setup

‚òÖ Install the shell integration (in `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zshrc`):
```bash
eval "$(bud --shell-init --with-completion)"
```

A safer version:
```bash
type bud > /dev/null 2> /dev/null && eval "$(bud --shell-init --with-completion)"
```

### Configuration

If you usual work with repos from the same organization (like your personal one), you can set it as a default:

```
export BUD_DEFAULT_ORG="google"
```

Then you can use it directly to create, clone and jump to those repos:
```bash
$ bud clone pytruth
```
Rather than:
```bash
$ bud clone google/pytruth
```

## Usage

```yaml
